This folder contains the ASP code for the implementation of JCI-ASD, based originally on the code of Hyttinen et al. (2014).
Here is a quick explanation of how the ASP files can be used and combined.

1. Include one of the files corresponding to separations and graph type:
	asd_acyclic.pl:			d-separation encoding (acyclic)
	asd_acyclic_sufficient.pl:	d-separation encoding (acyclic, no latent confounders)
	asd_cyclic.pl:			d-separation encoding (cyclic)
	asd_sigma_cyclic.pl:		sigma-separation encoding (cyclic)

2. Include one of the following files to generate the computation tree:
	obs_comp_tree.pl:	observational-only computation tree (most suitable for JCI)
	partial_comp_tree.pl:	partial computation tree, suitable for perfect interventions (fast)
	full_comp_tree.pl:	full computation tree, suitable for perfect interventions (slow)

3a. Include the set of JCI assumptions that should be made:
	jci123.pl:		JCI assumptions 1,2,3 (all JCI assumptions)
	jci12indc.pl:		JCI assumptions 1,2, and assume independent context variables
3b. Or, add a combination of:
	jci1.pl:                JCI assumption 1 (exogenous context nodes)
	jci2.pl:                JCI assumption 2 (randomization)
	jci3.pl:                JCI assumption 3 (purely confounded context variables)

4. Set the following global constants accordingly:
	#const nrnodes=6.  % total number of nodes
	inode(0..2).       % nodes 0,1,2 are context nodes, all other nodes (3,4,5) are then considered as system nodes

For some examples, see the folder ../../../examples.
